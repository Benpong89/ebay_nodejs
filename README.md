Plan:

1.  Create a app directory and install Hapi
2.  Set up Postgres database (How to link up with node.js app?)
3.  Create ebay_clone database and tables for users, auctions and bids.
4.  Set up Hapi server.js file per documentation
5.  Start setting up routes. Just print out logs for now to make sure routes are working
6.  Knex functions to manipulate Postgres
7.  Enter in a seed user into db
8.  Try to get it with a get request from Hapi server
9.  Create a Knex script to insert a new user
10. Link up Hapi HTTP call to create a new user through Knex functions
11. Create all the endpoints requests through Hapi and Knex functions

To complete:

1.  Configure Joi to validate parameters based on a schema.
2.  User auth
